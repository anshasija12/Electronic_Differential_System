# Electronic_Differential_System
This project implements torque vectoring using the Ackermann model and includes various features. The EV prototype ECU, built on two ESP32s, controls two motors and a LiPo battery, managed by a custom remote with Arduino and ESP8266. It features in-house current and voltage sensors, and an RPM meter, and publishes data to an MQTT, ESP-NOW for remote control.

This was part of my engineering project, and I have documented my work. You can find a comprehensive PDF of the project through this link here
