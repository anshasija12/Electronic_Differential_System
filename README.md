# Electronic_Differential_System
This project implements torque vectoring using the Ackermann model and includes various features. The EV prototype ECU, built on two ESP32s, controls two motors and a LiPo battery, managed by a custom remote with Arduino and ESP8266. It features in-house current and voltage sensors, an RPM meter,publishes data to an MQTT,ESP-NOW for remote control.
